# GANSpace implementation

The clone folder consists of an extended version of the GANSpace GitHub library, commit [65b0c4c7a4bbdcb5fedebb7c033dab59e27d61c0](https://github.com/harskish/ganspace/tree/65b0c4c7a4bbdcb5fedebb7c033dab59e27d61c0).

The clone is included since the main GitHub repository contained some bugs in order to work with Ubuntu 20.04. These bugs have been resolved in this clone and an updated [SETUP.MD](clone/ganspace/SETUP.md) is foreseen.

## Student info
- **Name**: Bontinck Lennert
- **StudentID**: 568702
- **Affiliation**: VUB - Master Computer Science: AI

## Recommended system
Since StyleGAN is funded by NVIDIA, in order for StyleGAN and thus GANSpace to properly work, an NVIDIA graphics card is needed. Ubuntu version 20.04 is also recommended since that is the one used for this project and a Linux distribution is recommended by the GANSpace developers.

## Edited parts
- Included the used [Pycuda folder](clone/ganspace/pycuda-2020.1)
- Updated [SETUP.MD](clone/ganspace/SETUP.md)

\chapter*{Abstract}
As per requirement of the Computational Creativity course, a small computational creative system will be designed and constructed.
This will be done by completing multiple smaller milestones.
This report focuses on the first of those milestones.
The creative domain, car design, is defined and discussed in this report.

In part \ref{part:backstory}, a backstory is given to explain how the idea of choosing car design came to be. Section \ref{sec:new_era} introduces the domain and where creative systems can and have been used.
In section \ref{sec:carguy} my personal background knowledge in this domain is given.

Part \ref{part:creative_system} explains abstractly how the creative system will function by discussing what the system will generate and what data it will use.
This will flow into part \ref{part:hurdles} which briefly touches upon which components will be needed for this system and what the expected hurdles are.

All source files for this project are available on GitHub \citep{github_project}. It is noted that this report is written by modifying the VUB based \LaTeX{} template from \citet{latex_template}.

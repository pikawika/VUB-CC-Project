\chapter*{Abstract}
As per requirement of the Computational Creativity course, a creative system will be designed and constructed.
This will be done by completing multiple smaller milestones.
This report focuses on the third of those milestones.
Some more information is given about which data will be used for the system.
The expected flow of the system, a schedule for development and some technical aspects are discussed as well.

Section \ref{sec:data} discusses what data is needed, how it could be collected and which pre-bundled datasets exist.
Section \ref{sec:required_components} highlights the four most important components for the system and what technology should be used for them.
In section \ref{sec:issues} it is explained that some issues where encountered this milestone resulting in a sub-optimal report. 
Finally a new, less error-prone, schedule is given in section \ref{sec:roadmap}.

\section{Issues this assignment}
\label{sec:issues}

As was discussed in the previous assignment the goal was that a basic version of the GAN would already be implemented by now.
The training process over a subset of the LSUN-Stanford Car Dataset was initiated (using the first 200.000 images) but crashed prematurely. 
It wasn't directly clear why my computer crashed and restarting this process and get a working demo on time for this assignment would not have been possible.
Because of this, this report was shorter and less fine-tuned than the previous ones.
However, a clear understanding of what is needed and how it can be achieved is clearly in place.

\section{Expected roadmap}
\label{sec:roadmap}

The following forms an expected roadmap for the remainder of this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 23/03 - 02/04: Implementation of the evaluation tool and writing of the evaluation assignment.
    \item 02/04 - 11/04: Development of the GAN.
    \item 11/04 - 15/04: Control over the GAN and collection of images/videos for evaluation.
    \item 15/04 - 29/04: Collection of evaluation data.
    \item 29/04 - 18/05: Writing of the research paper.
\end{itemize}

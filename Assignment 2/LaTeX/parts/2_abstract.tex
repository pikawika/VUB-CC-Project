\chapter*{Abstract}
As per requirement of the Computational Creativity course, a small computational creative system will be designed and constructed.
This will be done by completing multiple smaller milestones.
This report focuses on the second of those milestones.
Relevant literature to the creative domain, car design, is analysed and discussed in this report.

In part \ref{part:literature} the studied literature is discussed. Section \ref{sec:generating_visuals} explores the domain of generative AI for visual documents. In section \ref{sec:black_box_problem} the black-box problem is discussed and relative literature to combat this problem is analyzed. The last section of this part compares the evaluation criteria used in the creative domain.

The second and last part summarizes the findings by giving a proposed vision on how to create the system in section \ref{sec:proposal} with section \ref{sec:hurdles} discussing some hurdles that might be encountered.

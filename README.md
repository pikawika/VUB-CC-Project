## GANSpace tool
The GANSPace tool used is a modified version of the publicly available GANSpace tool, commit [65b0c4c](https://github.com/harskish/ganspace/tree/65b0c4c7a4bbdcb5fedebb7c033dab59e27d61c0). This version had some issues to work with Ubuntu 20.04, hence why it was modified. 

A custom "creative car design" setting was also added, which includes optional features such as saving the canvas to a PNG file.

## Evaluation tool
To evaluate the creativity and quality of the creative system a subjective survey was conducted. A custom tool was made for this subjective survey by modifying code from a [previous project of mine](https://github.com/pikawika/bachelorproef-compressie).
